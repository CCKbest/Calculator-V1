# My First Simple Calculator

💻 This is my first Calculator Program, as the name itself says, It took me a while to build 🖥️

### How to Run it?

    1. Clone this repository on your account

    2.  Open a Terminal ( Git ) on the folder

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Run this command `git calculator V1.cpp -o calculator` 

    4. Run `calculator.exe` ( Windows ) or `./calculator` ( Mac )

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Or use .exe directly

## What can you expect?

    1. Simple mathematical operations with all symbols ( + ) ( - ) ( * ) ( / )  -- ( FULLY FUNCTIONAL ) 🟩

    2. Divisions by 0, Will say "What is wrong with the operation or a similar message" -- ( FULLY DONE ) 🟩

    3. It checks if you have entered an invalid number when asked for the operators -- ( FULLY FUNCTIONAL ) 🟩

    4. It'll execute the Calculator until the user refuses with a "n" -- ( FULLY FUNCTIONAL ) 🟩

    5. It accepts both ( y ) and ( Y ) -- ( FULLY FUNCTIONAL ) 🟩 

## Future Improvements

    1. The next version will be a more minimalistic and compressed version ( IT'S MORELESS SIMPLE )  🟨

    2. More complex operators -- ( ONLY ALLOWS SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS )  🟥

    3. It will have more security measures -- ( NOT YET IMPLEMENTED )  🟥

## ROADMAP ( For Future Prievews ) 

    - This Calculator 🟩 - Calculator Improvements  🟨 - More Complex Systems... 🟥

    -  More to Come....
